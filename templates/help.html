        <h3>How to connect to your new server</h3>
    </p>
    <h4>On GNU/Linux</h4>
    <p>The best way to connect to your new server is through SSH, you can do so through your terminal emulator with:</p>
    <pre class="strong-fonts">
        user@host~ $ ssh root@server-ip
    </pre>

    <h4>On Windows</h4>
    <p>If you're using a Windows box, there are tools out there to connect to your GNU/Linux server. Our recommendation is
        <a href="http://http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" title="PuTTY Download">PuTTY</a>.
        There are other tools out there, but this is how you would connect to your new GNU/Linux server using PuTTY.
    </p>
    <p>
        After downloading PuTTY, open it and in the the <strong>Host Name (or IP address)</strong> box you type in your user
        and host and port number (<em>For full size, click on the picture</em>):

        </p>
    </p>
    <p>After that, it will prompt for password and you will have access to your server.</p>

    <h3>How to generate SSH RSA key for your server</h3>
    <h4>On GNU/Linux</h4>
    <p>This helps for security reasons to have an RSA keypair for your server and computer you use to connect to your
        server. It's really simple to do:</p>
    <pre class="strong-fonts">
        user@host~$ cd ~/.ssh
        user@host~/.ssh $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"
        Generating public/private rsa key pair.
        Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
        Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
        Enter same passphrase again:
        Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
        Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
        The key fingerprint is:
        0e:70:07:60:a7:fb:95:48:c7:c6:24:e6:be:e9:f1:d1 your@email.com
    </pre>
    <p>After that you can upload the <code>id_rsa.pub</code> to your server:
    <pre class="strong-fonts">
        user@host~$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@your-ip:~/
        user@host~ $ ssh root@your-ip
        Password:
        root@your-ip~# cat id_rsa.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    </pre>
    <p>
        After that you can log into your server without it asking for a password (<em>unless you added a passphrase on your id_rsa key</em>):
    </p>
    <pre class="strong-fonts">
        user@host~$ ssh root@your-ip
        root@your-ip~#
    </pre>
    <h4>On Windows</h4>
    <p>
        To do this on Windows is pretty simple. First you need to open <strong>PuTTYGen</strong>, search for it in your start
        menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/static/images/puttygen.png" title="PuTTYGen" target="_blank">

>>>>>>> 962efa51c699f54683f051466726cf79e3671a29
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>After you have opened PuTTYGen, you will click on <strong>Generate</strong></p>
    <p>
        <a href="/static/images/puttygen-generate.png" title="Generate" target="_blank">

            <img align="center" src="/static/images/puttygen-generate.png" height="320" width="240"/>

        </a>
    </p>

        <a href="/static/images/key-final.png" title="Key" target="_blank">

>>>>>>> 962efa51c699f54683f051466726cf79e3671a29
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Move your mouse in random patterns to generate the key, and click <strong>Save Public Key</strong> as well as
        <strong>Save Private Key</strong>. I always save mine as
        <code>id_rsa.pub</code> for public and <code>id_rsa.ppk</code> for private. After you've done this, you can SSH into
        your box and copy the <strong>Public key for pasting into OpenSSH
            authorized_keys file</strong> into your <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>After it is uploaded, you can direct PUTTY to use your new key. </p>

    </p>
    <p>You can save the connection in PuTTY, otherwise you will need to tell it to use this key each time you run it.</p>
    <p>
        <em>It is recommended that you disable <strong>root login</strong>, and add a user and login with your user. You do
        not have to do this, but it is recommended.
        </em>

    <h3>Setting up a Minecraft Server</h3>
    <p>
        This varies from distribution to distribution, but for the most part you need Java to do this. It is recommended to
        use Oracle's JVM, which on some distributions has a fetch restriction. So for a Gentoo/Funtoo system you have to
        download the files manually and add them to <code>/usr/portage/distfiles/</code>. For other distributions, they are
        packaged and you can install them.
    </p>
    <p>After you've installed Java, you simply download the <code>Minecraft_server.jar</code> from Minecraft's website and
        you run:
        <pre class="strong-fonts">
            user@host~$ java -jar Minecraft_server.jar nogui
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>Here is a simple BASH script to allow it to run in the background, and redirect the log.</p>
    <pre class="strong-fonts">
        #!/bin/bash nohup java -jar -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M minecraft_server*.jar nogui > minecraft.log </pre>
    <p>If you use less RAM, just replace <code>-Xmx1024M</code> and <code>-Xms1024M</code> with a lower value.</p>

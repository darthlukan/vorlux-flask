<p>We hate to ask the community this, but we are accepting donations. It is <strong>not</strong> cheap to run a hosting company, and the investors we have/had are not able to supply us with the money we need to get everything off the ground. In order for this site to become more sleek, and to have a better site with a control panel, managing your own servers, we need money to hire more people to help make this a reality. We also need to build a server to allow more than 4 GB of RAM on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: VPS">VPS</a> and another server to also host the <a href="http://openvz.org" target="_blank" title="OpenVZ">OpenVZ containers</a>. We could really use your help in making all of these things happen, and of course if you donate we will count what you donate towards your current plan, so you do not donate and then have to pay. We appreciate and accept all donations! If you'd like to donate, you can do so here:</p>
